## Project synopsis
This project allows an organised review of sales transactions by integrating main order data with secondary product details. Utilising Python and Jupyter notebooks, we cleanse, integrate, and analyse datasets to reveal sales patterns, product efficacy, and revenue leaders by city or area. The objective is to provide clear, actionable insights for business and analytics stakeholders. This project additionally exemplifies contemporary data pipeline methodologies in a reproducible manner.
